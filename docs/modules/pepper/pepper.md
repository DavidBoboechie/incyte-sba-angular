# Pepper

*Pepper* is a search & analytics app based on a modular, interactive and dashboard-based user interface.

Pepper has a single "search" route (which can easily replace the "search" route of Vanilla-Search, if the "home" and "preview" routes are required).

## Dashboard

The dashboard of Pepper is based on the [**angular-gridster2**](https://tiberiuzuld.github.io/angular-gridster2/) library.

Dashboards can be customized by the user by dragging and resizing widgets, and adding new ones from a list of predefined widget types. A developer can easily add new widget types, or configure the existing ones.

Dashboards can be saved with a name, re-opened later, and shared with colleagues.
